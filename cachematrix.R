# cachematrix.R contains two function makeCacheMatrix and cacheSolve, makeCacheMatrix accepts an

# invertible matrix this function has list of functions for setting, getting matrix and 

# setting and getting inverse of an invertible matrix

# Following are the functions and what the do

# 1. set - set the value of an invertible matrix

# 2. get - get the value of an invertible matrix set by makeCacheMatrix

# 3. setSolve - set the inverse of an invertible matrix

# 4. getSolve - get the inverse of an invertible matrix

# cacheSolve function get the inverse of an invertible matrix and cache it for future use



# makeCacheMatrix is function which accepts the invertible matrix as an argument,

        getSolve <- function() inv 

        list(set = set, get = get, setSolve = setSolve, getSolve = getSolve) 

}





# cacheSolve function accepts the special matrix created by makeCacheMatrix and checks if the inverse of the matrix is already available in cache if not it calculates

# the inverse of the matrix and puts the inverse in the cache



cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {

        # Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'

        inv <- x$getSolve()
